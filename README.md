# Research Proposal: Causal Network Analysis of Space-Induced Neurodegeneration in Mice with Human Gene Mapping

## Background
Spaceflight exposes organisms to unique environmental stressors, including microgravity and cosmic radiation, which can impact neurological health. While general effects have been studied, the specific causal mechanisms leading to neurodegenerative processes in space remain unclear. This study aims to delve deeper into these mechanisms using advanced causal inference techniques and explore their potential relevance to human health across multiple neurodegenerative diseases.

## Research Objectives
1. Construct a causal network of gene interactions related to neurodegeneration in mice exposed to spaceflight conditions.
2. Focus on a set of neurodegenerative diseases within the broader analysis.
3. Apply the PC algorithm to infer causal relationships between gene expression changes and neurodegenerative processes.
4. Map findings from mice to potential human impacts through comparative genomics.

## Data Source

- Reference: https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-352
- Includes gene expression data from mice exposed to spaceflight conditions
- Provides ground control data for comparison

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing and Initial Analysis
- Clean and normalize the OSD-352 dataset
- Perform differential gene expression analysis between spaceflight and control mice
- Identify significantly altered genes and pathways

### 2. Focused Analysis on Multiple Neurodegenerative Diseases
- Filter data to focus on genes known to be associated with various neurodegenerative diseases
- Analyze expression changes in disease-related genes and associated pathways
- Consider common pathways and unique features across different neurodegenerative conditions

### 3. PC Algorithm Application
- Apply the PC algorithm to the entire differentially expressed gene dataset to construct a global causal network
- Create sub-networks focused on differentially expressed genes related to different neurodegenerative diseases and their interactions
- Infer causal relationships between spaceflight conditions, gene expression changes, and neurodegenerative processes

### 4. Network Analysis and Visualization
- Identify key hub genes and central pathways in the causal network
- Visualize the network to highlight critical nodes and edges
- Compare the space-induced neurodegenerative networks with known pathways from Earth-based studies

### 5. Temporal Analysis
- If time-series data is available, incorporate temporal aspects into the causal network
- Analyze the progression of gene expression changes over the duration of spaceflight exposure

### 6. Human Gene Mapping and Comparative Analysis
- Map mouse genes in the causal network to their human orthologs
- Conduct comparative analysis to identify conserved pathways between mice and humans
- Assess the potential relevance of findings to human astronauts

### 7. Functional Validation
- Propose ground-based experiments to validate key causal relationships identified in the network
- Suggest potential space-based experiments for future missions to further test hypotheses

### 8. Translational Implications
- Identify potential biomarkers for early detection of space-induced neurodegenerative changes
- Propose interventions or countermeasures based on the causal network findings

## Novelty and Significance
- Application of the PC algorithm to space neurodegeneration data provides a new perspective on causal mechanisms
- Focus on multiple neurodegenerative diseases offers insights into various neurological processes in space
- Translation to human relevance enhances the impact for astronaut health and long-duration space missions

## Expected Outcomes
1. A comprehensive causal network of space-induced neurodegeneration in mice
2. Identification of key genes and pathways related to various neurodegenerative processes in space
3. Potential biomarkers for monitoring neurological health in space
4. Hypotheses about conserved neurodegenerative mechanisms between mice and humans in space environments
5. Suggestions for targeted interventions to mitigate space-induced neurodegeneration risk

## Potential Challenges (Limitations & Future Studies) and Solutions
- Complexity of the PC Algorithm: Implement feature selection methods to manage high-dimensional data
- Limited Sample Size: Utilize robust statistical methods designed for small sample sizes; consider meta-analysis with other relevant datasets if available
- Mapping to Humans: Collaborate with experts in comparative genomics and human space physiology to validate translational aspects
- Integrating Multiple Disease Pathways: Employ advanced bioinformatics techniques to identify common and unique features across different neurodegenerative conditions
- Limited to mice dataset as the human spaceflight dataset does not have brain samples to further validate the human results
